PROCEDURAL TILESET GENERATION TEST


** IMPORTANT NOTE: These controls only work if you are focused opn the game window. CLick on the game window in the unity editor then start button mashing :) **

WASD - Move character
E - enable and disable character collider so you can pass cliffs, tree trunks, and rocks

Space - generate a level completely with the given parameters
T - generate a level step by step with the given parameters. Press this multiple times to see the level generation process in more detail!

-- Generation Controls -- 
ALL generation controls and parameters can be found on the "GRID" gameobject in the unity hierarchy. Check for the Generation Parameter Section under the Terrain Wave Function Collapse class and mess around with the sliders! Each slider has a tooltip explaining what they do and their ideal values. Some can be extended past the ideal slider values but will get wonky. Happy generating!!!

***ART ASSETS HAVE BEEN REMOVED DUE TO AN NDA FOR THIS PROJECT, IT IS NOW NON FUNCTIONING. LOOK AT THE CODE ALL YOU WANT BUT UNTIL I GET A NEW TILESET IT WON'T BE FUNCTIONAL***
